# Parkinson Disease Prediction

### **1: Setting Up the Environment**

Before writing any code, you need to set up your Python environment.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: 
   - A virtual environment is an isolated environment where you can install dependencies (libraries) required for your project without affecting other projects on your system.
   - You create this environment using the `venv` module and activate it depending on your operating system.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are essential for data handling, model training, and visualization. These are installed via `pip`.

### **2: Importing Libraries and Loading the Dataset**

This step involves importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - `pandas` and `numpy` are used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
   - `scikit-learn` provides tools for machine learning, such as data splitting, preprocessing, and model building.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are used for visualizing the data.

2. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - We use the UCI Parkinson's dataset, which contains biomedical voice measurements from patients. This dataset helps in predicting whether a patient has Parkinson's Disease (`status` column).

### **3: Data Preprocessing**

Preprocessing is crucial because raw data often needs cleaning and preparation before it can be fed into a machine learning model.

1. **Understanding the Data**:
   - This involves checking the structure of the dataset using `.info()` and `.describe()`, and ensuring there are no missing values. Missing values, if present, must be handled appropriately.

2. **Splitting Features and Target**:
   - We separate the dataset into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
   - Features are the inputs to the model, and the target is what we are trying to predict (in this case, whether the patient has Parkinson's).

3. **Splitting the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`. 
   - The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

4. **Feature Scaling**:
   - Scaling ensures that all features are on the same scale, which is especially important for algorithms like SVM.
   - `StandardScaler` standardizes the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

### **4: Building and Training the Model**

This is where you create and train the machine learning model.

1. **Building the Model**:
   - We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. SVM is effective for classification tasks, especially in cases where the data is not linearly separable.

2. **Making Predictions**:
   - After training the model, we use it to predict the labels on the test data.

### **5: Evaluating the Model**

Evaluation metrics help us understand how well our model is performing.

1. **Accuracy Score**:
   - The accuracy score is the percentage of correct predictions out of the total predictions. Itâ€™s a simple measure of model performance.

2. **Confusion Matrix**:
   - A confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model by showing the actual vs. predicted values.
   - It helps in understanding the types of errors the model is making (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives).

3. **Classification Report**:
   - The classification report includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These metrics give a detailed view of model performance:
     - **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
     - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
     - **F1-Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
